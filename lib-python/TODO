TODO list for 2.7.0
===================

You can find the results of the most recent buildbot run at:
http://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=branch/fast-forward


Probably easy tasks
-------------------

- Missing builtin: bytes = str

- Missing builtin: bytearray (possibly reuse module.__pypy__.bytebuffer)

- Seen in test_inspect, this has never worked in pypy::

      assert eval('a', None, dict(a=42)) == 42

- Missing complex.__trunc__

- Mark some tests as "implementation specific"::

      @test_support.cpython_only

- (list|str|unicode|bytearray).(index|find) should accept None as indices

- Fix fcntl.fcntl(fd, fcntl.F_NOTIFY, fcntl.DN_MULTISHOT) on 32bit platform.

- Missing module future_builtins

Medium tasks
------------

- Ast objects should be picklable, see in pypy/module/_ast/test/test_ast.py:
  test_pickle()

- "exceptions must be old-style classes or derived from BaseException, not str"
  in the 'raise' statement and generator.throw()

- missing builtin: memoryview

Longer tasks
------------

- Implement the _io module.  At least _io.FileIO, and have io.py import
  everything from _pyio.py

- Finish _multiprocessing

- Update the _ssl module (entry point is now _ssl.sslwrap)

More difficult issues
---------------------

- In socket.py, """The implementation currently relies on reference counting to
  close the underlying socket object."""

- Implement an after-fork hook (See PyOS_AfterFork in CPython) to clear thread
  state in a forked interpreter.
  Then unskip test_3_join_in_forked_from_thread() in test_threading.py.
