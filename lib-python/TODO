TODO list for 2.7.0
===================

Probably easy tasks
-------------------

- Missing builtin: bytes = str

- Missing builtin: bytearray (possibly reuse module.__pypy__.bytebuffer)

- Octal literals: 0o777

- Seen in test_inspect, this has never worked in pypy::

      assert eval('a', None, dict(a=42)) == 42

- Missing (float|int).(imag|real)

- Missing complex.__trunc__

- Missing thread._count()

- Mark some tests as "implementation specific"::

      @test_support.cpython_only

Longer tasks
------------

- Implement the _io module.  At least _io.FileIO, and have io.py import
  everything from _pyio.py

- Finish _multiprocessing

More difficult issues
---------------------

- In socket.py, """The implementation currently relies on reference counting to
  close the underlying socket object."""
