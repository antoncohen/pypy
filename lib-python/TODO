TODO list for 2.7.0
===================

- Missing builtin: bytes = str

- Missing builtin: next = space.next(w_obj)

- Missing builtin: bytearray (possibly reuse module.__pypy__.bytebuffer)

- Octal literals: 0o777

- Seen in test_inspect, this has never worked in pypy::

      assert eval('a', None, dict(a=42)) == 42

- Implement the _io module.  At least _io.FileIO, and have io.py import
  everything from _pyio.py

- Finish _multiprocessing
