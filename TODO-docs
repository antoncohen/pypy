Documentation TODO
==================

General
-------

* structure documentation and add appropriate toctrees
* integrate numerous getting started documents into something more useful
  (eg. "Installing PyPy", "Building PyPy from source", "Playing with the
  RPython Toolchain", "Write your own interpreter in RPython")
* architecture documents don't really show the separation between PyPy and RPython
* where should the documentation about coding style etc. be put?


Cleanup
~~~~~~~

* remove documentation for removed features
* update / remove dead links


Meta
~~~~

* make inter-documentation links work
* work on configuration/options documentation generation


RPython
-------

* remove duplication between translation.rst and rtyper.rst.
* rename / move rpython.rst?


PyPy
