[fijal] I think following is done, please update
* do something about not seeing a loop at all; maybe disable
  temporarily(?) recognizing foreign can_enter_jit()

* Optimization: bridges from interpreter to compiled code

* support floats

* fix bugs in virtualizables, but think first

* support unicode

* support recursive portals (since we have support for all kinds of bridges,
  seems to be rather straight-forward)
