* find a test for r64742 (JitException capture)

* fix HashCollisionException, it appears in the wild

* do something about _weakref module, it's usually needed by everyone

* look at some remaining crashes

* support floats

* fix bugs in virtualizables, but think first

* kill empty pairs setup_exception_block/teardown_exception_block

* long term: memory management of the compiled code (free old code)
