Simplified virtualizables
=========================

As a first step for speeding up code, we plan to implement simplified version
of virtualizables. Simplified in a sense that it won't support virtuals stored
on virtualizables.

For those unaware:

* Virtuals are objects which are known not to escape from jit code, hence
  they're not allocated at all and their fields are stored in registers and or
  on the stack.

* Virtualizables are objects that are known to escape (for example the frame
  object), but they're stored anyway on the stack with a way to access and
  modify from outside the jit code. So the jit knows where they're and have
  a way to reconstruct them if necessary.

The way to implement virtualizables would be as follows:

* During translation, all field accesses to virtualizables are replace by
  calls to helpers that read/write fields via the jit.
