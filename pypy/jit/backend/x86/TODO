* test_zrpy_exceptions, needed

* fix ll2ctypes for typeptr accesses (test_tl*)

* measure performance, improve

* use more registers, eventually

* optimization of comparison followed by a guard

* MC_SIZE, FRAMESIZE


Support for non-Boehm GCs:

* support calls to malloc and malloc_varsize from the generated assembler

* support root stack enumeration (at first, the easiest is probably to
  do it with asmgcc, which is good for performance :-)

* what to do about all ConstPtrs that end up embedded in the assembler?
  annoying with a moving GC

* support write_barriers (later; at first, we support the semispace gc only)
