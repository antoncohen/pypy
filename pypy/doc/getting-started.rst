What is PyPy ?
==============

PyPy is an implementation of the Python_ programming language written in
Python itself, flexible and easy to experiment with.
We target a large variety of platforms, small and large, by providing a
compiler toolsuite that can produce custom Python versions.  Platform, memory
and threading models, as well as the JIT compiler itself, are aspects of the
translation process - as opposed to encoding low level details into the
language implementation itself. `more...`_

Just the facts 
============== 

Clone the repository
--------------------

Before you can play with PyPy, you will need to obtain a copy
of the sources.  This can be done either by `downloading them
from the download page`_ or by checking them out from the
repository using mercurial.  We suggest using mercurial if one
wants to access the current development.

.. _`downloading them from the download page`: http://pypy.org/download.html

You must issue the following command on your
command line, DOS box, or terminal::

    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy pypy

This will clone the repository and place it into a directory
named ``pypy``, and will get you the PyPy source in
``pypy/pypy`` and documentation files in ``pypy/pypy/doc``.
We try to ensure that the tip is always stable, but it might
occasionally be broken.  You may want to check out `our nightly tests:`_
find a revision (12-chars alphanumeric string, e.g. "963e808156b3") 
that passed at least the
``{linux32}`` tests (corresponding to a ``+`` sign on the
line ``success``) and then, in your cloned repository, switch to this revision
using::

    hg up -r XXXXX

where XXXXX is the revision id.

.. _`our nightly tests:`: http://buildbot.pypy.org/summary?branch=<trunk>

If you want to commit to our repository on bitbucket, you will have to
install subversion in addition to mercurial.

Installing using virtualenv
---------------------------

It is often convenient to run pypy inside a virtualenv.  To do this
you need a recent version of virtualenv -- 1.5 or greater.  You can
then install PyPy both from a precompiled tarball or from a mercurial
checkout::

	# from a tarball
	$ virtualenv -p /opt/pypy-c-jit-41718-3fb486695f20-linux/bin/pypy my-pypy-env

	# from the mercurial checkout
	$ virtualenv -p /path/to/pypy/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c my-pypy-env

Note that bin/python is now a symlink to bin/pypy.


Where to go from here
----------------------

After you successfully manage to get PyPy's source you can read more about:

 - `Building and using PyPy's Python interpreter`_
 - `Learning more about the translation toolchain and how to develop (with) PyPy`_

.. _`Building and using PyPy's Python interpreter`: getting-started-python.html
.. _`Learning more about the translation toolchain and how to develop (with) PyPy`: getting-started-dev.html


Understanding PyPy's architecture
---------------------------------

For in-depth information about architecture and coding documentation 
head over to the `documentation section`_ where you'll find lots of 
interesting information.  Additionally, in true hacker spirit, you 
may just `start reading sources`_ . 

.. _`documentation section`: docindex.html 
.. _`start reading sources`: getting-started-dev.html#start-reading-sources

Filing bugs or feature requests 
-------------------------------

You may file `bug reports`_ on our issue tracker which is
also accessible through the 'issues' top menu of 
the PyPy website.  `Using the development tracker`_ has 
more detailed information on specific features of the tracker.
