Welcome to PyPy
===============

The PyPy project aims to produce a flexible and fast Python_
implementation.  This page documents the development of the PyPy
project itself. If you don't know what PyPy is, consult the `PyPy
website`_. If you just want to use PyPy, consult the `download`_ page
and the :doc:`getting-started-python` documents. If you want to help
develop PyPy -- keep reading!

PyPy is written in a language called `RPython`_, which is suitable for
writing dynamic language interpreters (and not much else). RPython is
a subset of Python and is itself written in Python.  If you'd like to
learn more about RPython, `XXXX` should provide a
reasonable overview.

**If you would like to contribute to PyPy**, please read :doc:`how to
contribute <how-to-contribute>` first.  PyPy's development style is somewhat different to
that of many other software projects and it often surprises
newcomers. What is **not** necessary is an academic background from
university in writing compilers -- much of it does not apply to PyPy
any way.

All of the documentation and source code is available under the MIT license,
unless otherwise specified. Consult :source:`LICENSE`.

Meeting PyPy developers
-----------------------

The PyPy developers are organizing sprints and presenting results at
conferences all year round. They will be happy to meet in person with
anyone interested in the project.  Watch out for sprint announcements
on the `development mailing list`_.
