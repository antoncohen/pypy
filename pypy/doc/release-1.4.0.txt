PyPy 1.4: Ouroboros in practice
===============================

Hello.

We're pleased to announce the 1.4 release of PyPy. This is a major breakthrough
in our long journey, as PyPy 1.4 is the first PyPy release that can translate
itself faster than CPython. Starting today, we plan to start using PyPy for our
own development.

Among other features, this release includes numerous performance improvements
(which made fast self-hosting possible), a 64-bit JIT backend, as well as serious
stabilization. As of now, we can consider the 32-bit version of PyPy stable enough
to run in production.

More highlights
===============

* Virtualenv support: now PyPy is fully compatible with virtualenv_: note that
  to use it, you need a recent version of virtualenv (>= 1.5).

* Faster (and JITted) regular expressions - huge boost in speeding up
  sre module.

* Faster (and JITted) calls to functions like map().
