PyPy 1.3: Self hosting
=======================

Hello.

We're pleased to announce release of PyPy 1.4. This is a major breaktrhough
in our long journey, since PyPy 1.4 is the first PyPy release that can translate
itself faster than CPython. Since today, we're planning to be starting using
PyPy for our own development.

Among other features, this release includes numerous performance improvements
(which made fast self-hosting possible), 64jit backend as well as serious
stabilization. As of now, we can consider 32bit version of PyPy stable enough
to run in production.
