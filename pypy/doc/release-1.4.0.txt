PyPy 1.4: Ouroboros in practice
===============================

Hello.

We're pleased to announce the 1.4 release of PyPy. This is a major breakthrough
in our long journey, as PyPy 1.4 is the first PyPy release that can translate
itself faster than CPython. Starting today, we plan to start using PyPy for our
own development.

Among other features, this release includes numerous performance improvements
(which made fast self-hosting possible), a 64-bit JIT backend, as well
as serious stabilization. As of now, we can consider the 32-bit and 64-bit
linux versions of PyPy stable enoughto run in production.

Numerous speed achievements are described on `our blog`_. Normalized speed
charts comparing `pypy 1.4 and pypy 1.3`_ as well as `pypy 1.4 and cpython 2.6`_
are available on benchmark website. For impatient: yes, we got a lot faster!

More highlights
===============

* `Virtualenv support`_: now PyPy is fully compatible with virtualenv_: note that
  to use it, you need a recent version of virtualenv (>= 1.5).

* Faster (and JITted) regular expressions - huge boost in speeding up
  sre module.

* Faster (and JITted) calls to functions like map().
